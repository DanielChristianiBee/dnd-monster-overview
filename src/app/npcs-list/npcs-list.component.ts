    { id: 3, name: 'Wreybar Wompeder', description: 'Wrybar Wompeder was born in a small gnomish village nestled in the deep forests east of the Sword Mountains. From a young age, he exhibited a keen intellect and an deep curiosity about the natural world. While his friends were content with traditional gnome crafts, Wrybars interests extended to the behaviors and habitats of animals, especially badgers. He spent countless hours observing them, fascinated by their tenacity and complex burrowing systems. As Wrybar grew older, his desire for adventure and discovery led him to leave his village. He journeyed through the Sword Mountains, facing numerous perils and learning the ways of survival. His travels eventually brought him to a solitary hill, which he would later name Badger Hill. The hill reminded him of the burrowing animals he admired so much, and he decided to settle there. Using his knowledge of burrowing creatures, Wrybar spent years excavating and expanding a network of tunnels and chambers beneath Badger Hill. His underground lair became a marvel of engineering, complete with hidden rooms and secret passages. Each tunnel was very reinforced, ensuring the lairs stability and security. Wrybar filled his subterranean home with all manner of curiosities, from rare herbs to ancient artifacts, all acquired through his travels and trade. Wrybars lair became a well-kept secret among travelers and adventurers. Those who stumbled upon his small house atop Badger Hill soon discovered the vast inventory of goods he had amassed. Wrybar sold provisions, equipment, and rare items to anyone who passed by, often at a fair price. His reputation for having "everything you could ever need" spread far and wide, attracting a steady stream of customers. Despite his humble appearance, Wrybar is mysteriously wealthy. His riches come from a combination of shrewd trading, hidden caches of treasure discovered during his adventures, and perhaps even a few clandestine dealings with powerful entities. However, Wrybar keeps his wealth well hidden, preferring the simple life of a reclusive merchant to the trappings of opulence. Wrybars fascination with badgers never waned. Though he does not keep any as pets, his lair is adorned with badger-themed decor, and he often tells tales of their cunning and bravery. He believes that badgers possess a wisdom and resilience that many underestimate, qualities he strives to embody in his own life. Now, Wrybar lives a content life on Badger Hill, his underground lair a testament to his skills and passions.

    { id: 4, name: 'Fladnag the Blue', description: 'Fladnag the Blue is a figure shrouded in mystery and legend. Born into a family of powerful wizards, each known for their mastery of a different magical discipline, Fladnag discovered his gift for divination at a young age. While his siblings honed their abilities in controlled environments, Fladnag was drawn to the unpredictable and the unknown. Embracing the wandering life of a seer, Fladnag set out on a journey to understand the intricate weavings of fate and time. He crafted an enchanted cart to serve as both his home and workshop, filled with curious instruments, ancient tomes, and magical ingredients. This cart, a mobile repository of knowledge and mystery, allows Fladnag to traverse the world, offering glimpses of the future to those he encounters. Fladnags predictions are famously enigmatic, often delivered in riddles that challenge those seeking answers to think deeply about their choices and destinies.

    { id: 5, name: 'Egorim the Purple', description: 'Egorim the Purple, a member of the enigmatic wizard family known for their distinct colored robes, has always been fascinated by the cosmos. From a young age, he showed a natural affinity for celestial magic, drawn to the mysteries of the stars and the movements of celestial bodies. Unlike his brother Fladnag, whose divinations are often cryptic and whimsical, Egorims approach to magic is more methodical and scientific. Egorim chose the seclusion of the Hotenow Mountains in the Sword Coast as his home, where he could study the stars in uninterrupted peace. Perched on a mountaintop, his observatory is a marvel of magical architecture, dominated by a massive telescope of his own design. This telescope, enchanted and meticulously crafted, serves as his primary tool for both magical and astronomical studies.

His customers, often adventurers or scholars, seek him out despite the cost, knowing that his works are unparalleled in their magical quality. Egorims life on the mountaintop is one of solitude, dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge and the crafting of his magical wares. His obsession with his telescope, which occupies much of his home, symbolizes his deep connection to the cosmos. Through it, he seeks to unravel the secrets of the universe, believing that the stars hold answers to questions both cosmic and mundane. Despite his reclusive nature, Egorim occasionally shares his knowledge and creations with the outside world, albeit selectively. Those who seek him out find a wizard whose gaze is often fixed not on the ground, but on the stars, searching for patterns and truths that transcend the ordinary.

    { id: 7, name: 'Balkum Axelite', description: 'Balkum Axelite, once a paragon of strength and valor within the Draconic Order of Djerad Thymar, is a dragonborn of both legend and formidable presence. Known for his remarkable victory over a fearsome red dragon many years ago, Balkum was celebrated for his prowess and strategic brilliance. His achievements established him as a senior figure in the Order, revered by many for his unmatched combat skills and leadership. As Balkum aged, his demeanor transformed significantly. The once-proud warrior, who had been a model of discipline and respect, grew increasingly grumpy and irritable. His long years of service and numerous battles left him jaded and less tolerant of what he saw as the shortcomings and incompetence of others. His interactions became marked by a sharp tongue and a tendency to dismiss the ideas and efforts of those he deemed unworthy or misguided. His gruff and demanding nature made him a challenging figure to please, and his expectations for others grew exceedingly high. Those who worked with or for him found him difficult to approach, as he was quick to criticize and slow to offer praise. This change in temperament, though a byproduct of his extensive experience and disillusionment, earned him a reputation as a difficult and often abrasive mentor. Despite his growing surliness, Balkum remained fiercely loyal to the Draconic Order and its mission. When reports of a white dragon terrorizing the Sword Coast emerged, Balkum was assigned to investigate the threat. His extensive knowledge and experience were deemed crucial in addressing the new danger. He set out with a determined, if somewhat begrudging, resolve to confront the dragon and assess the situation. Unfortunately, after his initial report indicating his arrival in the Sword Coast region, all communication from Balkum ceased abruptly. The Order, deeply concerned for their esteemed yet increasingly reclusive elder, dispatched Draco—an up-and-coming warrior from the Order—to locate Balkum and deal with the white dragon. Balkums current whereabouts and condition remain a mystery, his disappearance adding a layer of urgency and complexity to Dracos mission. The grumpy and demanding elder dragonborn’s fate is now a matter of great concern, both for the Order and for those who had to endure his difficult personality. His last known actions and the enigmatic silence that followed have become central to Dracos quest, adding personal and professional stakes to the search for both the missing warrior and the dragon threatening the Sword Coast.', imageUrl: 'https://www.dansimworld.nl/afbeeldingen/balkum.png' },

A drow elf of unnerving silence, he serves as the elusive right hand to Nezznar, the Black Spider, in the web of darkness they weave together. Jivrils past is a tapestry of secrets, his motives concealed even from those who serve alongside him. Once a druid of the Underdark, he forsook the natural order for something darker. Its said that the creatures of the deep listen to his call, obeying commands only they can comprehend. No one knows what drives his loyalty to Nezznar. Perhaps it is power, perhaps something more ancient and sinister. His actions are decisive, his presence a reminder that even the darkness has its predators. Jivril Nin remains a mystery, a shadow within the shadow, and those who dare to pry too deeply into his past seldom live to tell the tale.
