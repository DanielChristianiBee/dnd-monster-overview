Hobgoblins have dark orange or red-orange skin, and hair ranging from dark red-brown to dark gray. Yellow or dark brown eyes peer out beneath their beetling brows, and their wide mouths sport sharp and yellowed teeth. A male hobgoblin might have a large blue or red nose, which symbolizes virility and power among goblinkin. Hobgoblins can live as long as humans, though their love of warfare and battle means that few do. By and large, hobgoblins, like their kin, are considered to be evil creatures and often meet this expectation. While goblinoid society is typically cruel and harsh, some individuals escape it to carry on lives of virtue. The few who take this risk and succeed often met cautious praise and acceptance from outsiders. Those that manage to escape goblinoid society, however, are continuously plagued by their goblinoid nature. Though hobgoblins are not necessarily evil, they are prone to violence and hot tempers, and often find it difficult to be truly altruistic. When provoked, which is not a hard task, hobgoblins are vindictive creatures who take glee in causing pain to those that injure them. Those hobgoblins who overcome this nature often manage this because of the rewards they find in serving good, rather than evil.
